Insomnia logger
===============

Insomnia is a simple WebSocket-based app that listens for "MESSAGE_CREATE" events from Discord's API. Whenever a new message is received, the message details gets logged into a file called "messages.log". Simple as that.

Configuration are done through environment variables. These are the environment variables you need to define before runtime:

export INSOMNIA_TOKEN=""
export INSOMNIA_USER_AGENT=""
export INSOMNIA_BROWSER=""
export INSOMNIA_OS=""

You can make this a systemd service in a Linux machine that runs 24/7 as long as the machine is up.
